  "description" : "[h2] Notices [/h2]\n[list]\n[*] This mod has a lot of moving parts, and was made in about a week (not including testing). Expect there to be some bugs, as well as features that may need tweaking. Please report such on this page and I'll try to fix them as soon as I can.\n[*] This mod uses the same general method as the proximity mode of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3445409664] Star Custom Chat RP [/url] by Degranon. That mod isn't required for this one, and the two should be able to work together, but I'd recommend turning off proximity chat and languages from that mod if you're using this one.\n[*] I haven't done much testing with Open Starbound for this mod, and multiplayer testing has been limited. If you use that client and find issues, I'll try to fix them, but it may take more time than other bugs, since I don't use the client.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2] About [/h2]\nInspired by a really impressive server that unfortunately closed, this chat mod that adds a new chat mode which manages and alters incoming and outgoing messages based on proximity. This allows for a truly local chat system with various formatting options depending on the intended type of message being sent.\n\nThe mod also adds support for virtually infinite custom languages for use in roleplay scenarios. Players can create languages and use them in chat so only other players that know the language can understand some or all of the message.\n\nLastly, there is a basic toggleable autocorrect feature that lets you create entries for commonly misspelled words, which will then be automatically corrected to whatever you've set as the correction.\n\n[h2] Requirements [/h2]\nInline Proximity Chat for StarCustomChat, based on the proximity mode in the mod of the same name by Degranon. Requires [url=https://github.com/KrashV/StarCustomChat] Star Custom Chat[/url] and either [url=https://github.com/StarExtensions/StarExtensions] Star Extensions[/url] or [url=https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound] Open Starbound[/url]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] How to use the mod [/h1]\nThe following will go over how the mod works and how to format messages. In the future, I'll add an ingame menu for this reference.\n\n[h2] Chat Controls [/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Actions - He does this: Default state, writing a full message without any quotes or indicators will post an action. Actions require line of sight to be received.\n[*] \"Quotes\": Use [u]\"...\"[/u] to open and close quotes. They have a shorter range than actions, but do not need direct line of sight so long as there is open air between the sender and receiver.\n[*] <Sounds>: Use [u]<...>[/u] to open and close sounds. They are identical to quotes in function, but are intended for noises made by things, rather than people.\n[*] Volume Control - :+/:- : Use [u]:+[/u] to increase the volume of a quote/sound. Use [u]:-[/u] to decrease it. Use [u]:=[/u] to reset it. You can make noises louder/quieter four times in each direction (:++++, :----)\n[*] ((Local OOC)): Use [u]((...))[/u] for local OOC. Local OOC has a range, and does not require line of sight, but may not be seen if players are far away.\n[*] {Radio}: Use [u]{...}[/u] for radio chat. This can be seen through walls, but is distinct from OOC, and supports languages.\n[*] /Emphasis/: Use [u]*...*[/u] or [u]/.../[/u] for emphasis (either one works). This changes nothing about the chat, but makes it anything inside of it a specific color.\n[*] \\Item Emphasis\\: Use [u]\\...\\[/u] for item emphasis. This is functionally identical to normal emphasis, but uses a different color.\n[*] Rolling - |100|: Use [u]|#|[/u] to roll a number between 1 and the provided maximum. The value should be consistent between players.\n[*] [IPC] Language: Use brackets around a language code ([u][...][/u]) to set the active language to the provided language, or use [u][][/u] or [u][!!][/u] to reset to the universal default. The chosen language will remain until another one is provided in the message.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Languages [/h2]\nLanguages in this mod work by checking player inventories for items that are created with language codes made up of some amount of letters. Depending on how many items with a given code a player has, they will understand more or less of a language.\n\nSomeone who's 90/80/50/etc% proficient will know about 90/80/50/etc% of the words in the language. This proficiency can be increased or decreased with more or fewer items in your inventory. By default, the language [b][!!][/b] is universal, and everyone can understand it regardless of whether or not they have any items with the code.\n\nUsing empty brackets [b][][/b] will reset the active language to the player's default language, or [b][!!][/b] if they do not have one.\n\nYou can have multiple default languages, the mod will find the first one in your inventory. Just remember to switch them around when you need them.\n[i]Note:[/i] Language items show up in the crafting components section of your inventory, since they're components to craft dialogue, or something like that.\n\n[h2] Typo Correction [/h2]\nYou can add and remove typos and corrections from a list stored in the player file. These are case sensitive and only work between punctuation and spaces. This tool is off by default.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Commands [/h1]\n/newlangitem name (String), code (String), count (Number), default (True/False), color (#hex code) - Createse new language items for your character.\n[list]\n[*] name: One word name for the language (you must use one word, no more)\n[*] code: The code that the language uses.\n[*] count: The number of items you're going to spawn, between 1 and 10. \n[*] default: Whether or not the language is a default language, meaning it will automatically be used when no code is provided\n[*] color: A custom color in which you'll see scrambled words of the language, otherwise they'll be random \n    [i]Note:[/i] Since this mod is clientside, only you will see the color you set for the language. If you make an item with blue, and someone else makes the same item with red, you'll see it as blue and they'll see it as red.\n[/list]\n\n/addtypo typo (String), correction (String) - Adds a typo to your typo list\n[list]\n[*] typo: The mistyped word, such as \"hte, adn, weast, s\"\n[*] correction: The intended word, such as \"the, and, west, a\"\n[/list]\n\n/removetypo typo (String) - Removes a typo from your typo list\n[list]\n[*] typo: The typo to remove\n[/list]\n\n/toggletypos - Activates or Deactivates typo correction, off by default.\n\n/checktypo - Checks the status of the typo correction tool.\n\n/showtypos - Shows the list of saved typos you have, and if the tool is on or off.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [!!] can be used for the code in a language item, so it may be worthwhile to generate a set of default language items with that code in case you make others later for niche situations\n[*] Sounds and quotes have a different volume manager, you can run a string like \":++HEY\" <:--scuffle> \"COME HERE!!\", and the sound will have \"-2\" volume, while the quotes will have \"+2\" for both segments.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Planned Enhancements [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Global radio channels (difficult to do clientside)\n[*] Global OOC chat\n[*] Encrypted radio channels\n[*] Automatically omitting character names from language scrambling\n[*] International Support. Right now this mod won't work with non-ASCII script\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Links [/h2]\n[url=https://github.com/cptsalt/Inline-Proximity-Chat]Github repository[/url]",
